How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    1. It helps to do the work manually.
    2. It helps to avoid mistakes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps to save a lot of time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually choosing: 
	Pro: I do not want to save all the versions for small changes and can pick up the good version I like to save.
	Con: It takes extra steps, and I might forget sometimes.
    Versions automatically saved:
	Pro: I do not need to worry about losing any version.
	Con: It takes a lot of more space and it saves a lot of trash I might never need.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because usually we save a project using Git, there usually are some dependencies between multiple files, it is better to allow saving them in one commit. While in Google docs, usually the documents are independent of each other, it is better to treat each other separately.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Type “git log”, it shows the history of the files
    Type “git diff old-file new-file”, it shows the things that have been changed in the old file. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We can always find the old versions back and make the comparison to fix the problem.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Use Git to open sublime Text 2 to write code or modify text files.
