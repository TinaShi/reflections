When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I need to have access to my files without my computer, or when I need to cooperate with other people, or when there is not much storage space on my local computer.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because there might be some changes that I do not want to keep on my local machine or I simply want two version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branch means develop a new chain of programs that does not affect the main or other chains. Clones and forks work for copying and pasting repositories, but they work under different situations. Branches work inside one repository, it helps to work on different parts of the program. Clones work on local repositories or help copy and paste repository between local repositories and remote repositories. Forks mainly work on GitHub. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It helps to run the program locally. Also there won't be conflicts when pushing it back to the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without Git or GitHub I used email and dropbox to share information. It is easier to use when most of the people in the group are not familiar with Linux, but it is harder to get everyone to get updated. It is also hard to put all the files in one place to share the history.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When we are not sure about whether our changes are great or acceptable by the collaborators, we want to make changes in a separate branch.
